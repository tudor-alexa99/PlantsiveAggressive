# Passive-Aggressive plant monitorisation device

This project will keep track of the humidity and temperature inside a room for a specific plant. When the values are too high or too low, a passive-aggressive message will be sent to the user.

For getting the temperature and humidiy values, we will use a DHT sensor.

Data will be stored in a cloud server and displayed through an application.
